# Condor_LeadMovement

Lead contamination, an exclusively human-induced issue, poses a serious threat to the critically endangered California Condor (Gymnogyps californianus). Contamination occurs through condorsâ€™ ingestion of lead ammunition residues embedded within the remains of shot animals. Detecting lead exposures typically requires resource-intensive and invasive interventions. Here, we explored a minimally invasive alternative, analyzing movement data from GPS-tagged condors in the 30-day period prior to when their blood lead levels were measured.
